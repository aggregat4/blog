<h1>But wait, there&#39;s more! (to consider about the ForkJoinPool and parallel streams)</h1>

<time datetime="2015-04-16">2015-04-16</time>

<p>I <a href="/posts/2015-04-14-caution-advised-when-using-the-java-forkjoinpool-or-parallel-streams-with-a-securityManager/">wrote earlier</a> about the problems with using a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html"><code>ForkJoinPool</code></a> explicitly, or implicitly through parallel streams, together with a SecurityManager. There are even more caveats with the way the <code>ForkJoinPool</code> is used by the parallel streams implementation and with the model of concurrency implemented by it.</p>
<p>The first issue with parallel streams is that they use a static, JVM-wide instance of a <code>ForkJoinPool</code>, called the <code>commonPool</code>. Implicitly using this opaque shared pool, you lose a lot of visibility into and control over important pool parameters that may be crucial to attaining high performance. Oleg Shelajev of Zeroturnaround <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-parallel-streams-are-bad-for-your-health/">writes</a> about some of the congestion and management issues you can run into.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the <code>ForkJoinPool</code> as it is implemented in the JDK offers a very specific and narrow form of parallel processing. Edward Harned from Coopsoft <a href="http://coopsoft.com/ar/Calamity2Article.html">writes at length</a> about many of the characteristics and pitfalls of the particular form of recursive decomposition as implemented by the Java <code>ForkJoinPool</code>. You need to be very aware of your particular parallelization problem and make a very considered decision about whether this kind of fork/join approach is right for you.</p>
<p>Combine these two aspects together: little to no control over the parameters of the shared JVM-wide commonPool and the very narrow utility of the fork/join parallelization model, and it becomes clear that the utility of parallel streams is very limited and harbours many hidden dangers.</p>
<p>It is possible that as things currently stand, it is a little bit too easy to shoot yourself in the proverbial foot.</p>
