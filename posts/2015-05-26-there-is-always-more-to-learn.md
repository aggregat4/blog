Wanting to change up my list of podcasts ([Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm), [Alternativlos](http://alternativlos.org/), [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w), [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/), [CRE: Technik, Kultur, Gesellschaft](http://www.coreint.org/), [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/), [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/), [Hello Internet](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/), [Pragmatic](http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic), [Raumzeit](http://raumzeit-podcast.de/), [Robot or Not?](https://www.theincomparable.com/robot/), [Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/), [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/), [The Flop House](http://www.flophousepodcast.com/), [The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/), [The Talk Show With John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/), [Upgrade](http://www.relay.fm/upgrade), [Welcome to Macintosh](http://www.macintosh.fm/), [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/)) a bit, I went on the lookout for something not Apple-related but still developer centric. I stumbled upon the [Fragmented podcast](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/) and have been continuously surprised at the amount and kind of things I learn from it. Notwithstanding reading the internet every day, this podcast managed to broaden my horizon: introduced new interesting people to read on the internet, discussed developing practices I either wasn't ([AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value)) or only tangentially ([RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)) aware of. It was a good example of the fact that every sizable community will have interesting things to learn that you don't already know about.
