<p>When you use declarative templates like lit-html or JSX or any other variant together with custom elements you will need to declare and use your custom elements as HTML tags. Since you canâ€™t construct your components with a non-default constructor you need to employ a different strategy for configuring them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose your configuration parameters as attributes</li>
<li>Expose all your dependency injection requirements (other services or objects) as properties</li>
</ul>
<p>When the custom element has ben added to the DOM you must make sure to inject all the dependencies and then initialize it. This seems a little bit more unsafe, but it allows declarative usage and it works fine.</p>
<p>There is an additional technique you can use to wire up components. Instead of wiring them up directly you can also work with certain conventions. For example a progress indicator could look at its ancestor elements by a certain class and use that to wire itself up.</p>
